You can also tap on a stop to bring up more details about the stop. Note that some stops have the same name. This is because it's hard to distinguish between some stops. You can view the unique name of a stop by going to its details view.\n\nYou can add to your favorites by holding on a stop, or from the stop's details view. You can remove favorites the same way.\n\nThe Near Me tab requires that the phone have an up to date GPS location. If that is not the case, the data reflected there will not be accurate.</string>
